# Airline Delay Prediction
This project is a Cloudera Machine Learning ([CML](https://www.cloudera.com/products/machine-learning.html)) **Applied Machine Learning Prototype**. It has all the code and data needed to deploy an end-to-end machine learning project in a running CML instance.

This project was initially created for the *End-to-end ML at Scale workshop*. It creates a model and front-end application that can predict the likelihood of a flight being cancelled based on historic flight data. The original dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018). By following the notebooks and scripts in this project, you will understand how to perform similar tasks on CML, as well as how to use the platform's major features to your advantage. These features include **model training with jobs**, **point-and-click model deployment**, and **ML application hosting**.
